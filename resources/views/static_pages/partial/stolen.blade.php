                        The cases of vehicle theft in Japan are unfortunately common; every year thousands of cars, buses, motorbikes, vans, etc. 
                        are stolen and exported to foreign countries. To avoid such mishaps, we offer our customers an advanced stolen car checking 
                        procedure to confirm whether the vehicle has been stolen or not. If you are purchasing a vehicle through SAT and are in doubt 
                        about the vehicle's history, you can request an inspection certificate to confirm the status of your vehicle.
