            <h4 class="safety-common-hdr mb-24 mt-24">How to Beware Of Fraudulent Activities</h4>
            <p class="safety-common-sub-hdr">Do Not Pay Before Investigating</p>
            <p class="safety-common-paragraph mb-24">
                Make sure to thoroughly check the documentation and paperwork of your vehicle of choice before
                paying
                for it. It can be very difficult to recover funds once you have been subjected to fraud. Therefore,
                always verify the authenticity of the seller and their vehicle to not get stuck with a bum deal and
                lose your money. In case you do have to make the verification trip because of distance or other
                reasons, payment through your credit card will ensure the protection of your funds and your peace of
                mind.
            </p>
            <p class="safety-common-sub-hdr">Keep Your Vehicle Safe From Buyers</p>
            <p class="safety-common-paragraph mb-24">
                If you are selling your car and seeing potential buyers, you must take precautionary measures to
                ensure your vehicle stays safe as well. Do not leave your vehicle unattended when a potential buyer
                is visiting, and do not hand them the car documents or car keys.
            </p>
            <p class="safety-common-paragraph mb-24">
                Additionally, do not leave the client without supervision in the car, and avoid being distracted
                when a customer visits because they can try to scam you into a lower price for your vehicle by
                intentionally tampering with its exhaust or parts to damage the engine.
            </p>
            <p class="safety-common-sub-hdr">Cyber Safety Precaution</p>
            <p class="safety-common-paragraph mb-24">
                Beware of spam calls and fraud calls from scammers who want to
                disclose your account information. You should stay vary of unprotected numbers that ask you to make
                a payment. Do not give out bank information to an unknown caller and always reach out to SAT Japan
                through email or call to ensure that the caller is us.

            <p class="safety-common-sub-hdr">Vehicular Investigation Scam</p>
            <p class="safety-common-paragraph mb-24">
                If a private seller reaches out to you independently and mentions any
                charges for the vehicular verification or gives you the reference of a costly and dubious vehicle
                checking site, they are potentially trying to scam you for money. It is your sole responsibility to
                check and verify the condition of the vehicle you are purchasing.

                            If the option for test drive is available by the seller, always test out the running of
                            the vehicle before buying in. Additionally, this is a good opportunity to check the
                            mechanics of the car for yourself and thoroughly experience the quality of the vehicle.
                            Check under the bonnet of the vehicle for any signs of wear and tear and ask the seller
                            personally for any details they may have left out.

                            investments. Take your seller with you and ensure that you do not hand a large sum of
                            money which will then be untraceable.

                            words that would be easy to predict. Add upper case and lower case letters with numbers
                            and other characters to avoid anyone hacking your accounts.
